## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Migo, please report it responsibly. **Do not open a public issue.**

Instead, email the maintainer or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/eduardoalba00/migo/security/advisories/new) to submit a report.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- The potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to release a fix as quickly as possible.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release only. We recommend always running the most recent version of both the server and client.
